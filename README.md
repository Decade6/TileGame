# TileGame

A python script that utilizes a greedy search algorithm (either best first or A star) to find a
solution to the Tile game and plays this "best path" where the "best path" is the solution with the least number of
tiles moves. I then created a second version utilizing adversarial search, making the A.I play against the user more intelligently.
